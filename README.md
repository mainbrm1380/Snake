This is a snake game developed using pygame. The classic snake game had only one consumable, apple. I've added two more consumables; ice, and chili.
The ice and chili each have different effects. The ice, once consumed, will slow down the snake, and the chili will increase snake's speed.
The apple will also increase the snake's speed, but at a lower rate.
